# R Production–Quality Control–Forecasting Project

## Overview

This project, written in R, applies statistical techniques to simulate a real-world quality control scenario. I used two-way ANOVA to analyze process factors affecting yield, a Chi-square test to examine defect patterns by shift, and time series analysis to forecast future production. The goal was to improve decision-making through data analysis and demonstrate a structured approach to quality assurance using statistical methods.

##Different Stages of the project

1. **Stage 1 – Process Optimization (Two-Way ANOVA)**  
   Analyzes the effects of catalyst type and temperature on polymer yield.

2. **Stage 2 – Quality Control Assessment (Chi-Square Test)**  
   Explores the relationship between production shifts and defect types.

3. **Stage 3 – Production Forecasting (Time Series Analysis)**  
   Forecasts monthly output using historical data and moving average models.
