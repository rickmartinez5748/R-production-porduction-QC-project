# R Production–Quality Control–Forecasting Project

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for the **Advanced Statistics for Analytics** course, completed by **Ricardo Martinez** in August 2025. The project simulates a real-world manufacturing scenario and is structured in three stages:

1. **Stage 1 – Process Optimization (Two-Way ANOVA)**  
   Analyzes the effects of catalyst type and temperature on polymer yield.

2. **Stage 2 – Quality Control Assessment (Chi-Square Test)**  
   Explores the relationship between production shifts and defect types.

3. **Stage 3 – Production Forecasting (Time Series Analysis)**  
   Forecasts monthly output using historical data and moving average models.
